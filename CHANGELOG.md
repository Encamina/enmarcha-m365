# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Each version and revision is followed by a date of change, specially for under development versions. Each entry provides the following information (when applicable):

- **Breaking Changes**: changes that may certainty affect consumers of the API or how it is expected to be used.
- **Major Changes**: big improvements in the code, like adding or enabling features, or bug fixes.
- **Minor Changes**: small changes that have little impact, like spell checks in an API's documentation, adding or removing comments, etc.

Also, any bug fix must start with the prefix �Bug fix:� followed by the description of the changes _per se_.

Previous classification is not required if changes are simple or all belong to the same category.
